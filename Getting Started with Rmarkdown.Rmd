```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# if set echo to false it will not display the codes during the final output
# eval - whether you want to evaluate the code, decide whether to run the code or not.
```

```{r install libraries}
library(tidyselect)
```



```{r create simple plot}


example_data <- rnorm(500)


example_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

>Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
